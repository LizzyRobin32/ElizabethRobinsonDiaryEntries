With more time I would:
1. Create unit tests for the controllers
2. Enable users to log in and share records
3. include authorisation for those who are editing/viewing and creating records
4. Make improvements to the UI:
	- Create a generic button layout that can be used by the buttons that are currently blue and underlined.
	- Improve layout of buttons in the search tab

How to run that application:
- Run on local host
- Search for Package Manger Console in VS and open
- In Package Manger Console run update-database
- once completed run the code in Local host.
- Please use the pages 'Diary Entries' and 'Search'.
